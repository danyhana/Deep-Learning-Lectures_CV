# Deep Learning for Computer Vision: an introduction

These lectures were given by me at a Master in Data Science. They fisrt part is a general introduction to TensorFlow (notebook 01), while the second part covers a general understanding of neural networks and CNN (notebooks 02,03). Lastly, an advanced application (denoising autoencoders) is shown.
